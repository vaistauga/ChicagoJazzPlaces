# Intro

This project was build during my attendance to Full-Stack Nanodegree at Udacity. The goal of the project was to build a single page application which creates a new service by combining several third party API.

# Features

* Display a list of suggestions for you to hear some of the best Chicago jazz musicians
* Displays best photo and description of each place (data pulled from FourSquare)
* You may use the filter field to displayed locations to find a specific one faster
* The location marker bounces when you click on it - maximum interactivity! ;)

# Technology

* JQuery
* Knockout
* NPM
* Google Maps API
* FourSquare API

# Future Improvements

This application has no backend. Most of the data shown is pull from either Google Maps or FourSquare. The only exception is the list of places which uses a simple JavaScript object to store the list. This 'database' needs to be replaced with an actuall database application.

Once that is done, I would add the capability add Jazzy places.

# How view

Application uses NPM package manager. To view the application pull the files and initialize NPM. From there simply open index.html.

I hope you like it!
